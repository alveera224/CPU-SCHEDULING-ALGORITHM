# CPU Scheduling Algorithms in Java

This project implements **CPU Scheduling Algorithms** in Java. It includes the following scheduling algorithms:

1. **First Come First Serve (FCFS)**
2. **Round Robin (RR)**
3. **Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF)**
4. **Highest Response Ratio Next (HRRN)**

---

## üöÄ Features

- Simulates different CPU scheduling algorithms.
- Provides metrics for each process:
  - Completion Time (CT)
  - Waiting Time (WT)
  - Turnaround Time (TAT)
- Includes a command-line interface (CLI) for user interaction.

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Run

### Prerequisites
1. **Java**: Ensure JDK 11 or higher is installed.
2. **Git**: To clone the repository.

### Steps
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/cpu-scheduling-algorithms.git
   cd cpu-scheduling-algorithms

# üìã Example Output
INPUT
Enter the number of processes: 3
Process 1 Name: P1
Arrival Time: 0
Burst Time: 5
Priority: 1
Process 2 Name: P2
Arrival Time: 1
Burst Time: 3
Priority: 2
Process 3 Name: P3
Arrival Time: 2
Burst Time: 8
Priority: 3

Select a Scheduling Algorithm:
1. First Come First Serve (FCFS)
2. Round Robin (RR)
3. Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF)
4. Highest Response Ratio Next (HRRN)
Enter your choice: 1

Output (FCFS):
Process    AT    BT    CT    TAT    WT
P1         0     5     5     5     0
P2         1     3     8     7     4
P3         2     8     16    14    6
